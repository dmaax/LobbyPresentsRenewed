Building
------
This project uses a custom NMS JAR file hosted on a private repository, when trying to build you _will encounter problems_.
To solve the issue you need to provide your own NMS dependencies (with <a href="https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/BuildTools.jar">BuildTools</a>), an example can be found on `pom.xml`.
